There are a handful of reasons that pairing a device can fail.

**PhonePresenter is not Running**

Check that PhonePresenter is running before pairing a device.


**Not on the Same Network**

Check that both the computer and device are connected to the same network.


**Bad Wi-Fi Connection**

PhonePresenter may not work well on slow or weak Wi-Fi connections.  Move closer to or reorient the Wi-Fi router to get a better signal.


**Blocked by a Firewall**

Ensure that a firewall is not blocking the PhonePresenter server.


**Incorrect Network Interface**

On a computer with multiple network interfaces, choose the correct interface on the main window before pairing a device.
