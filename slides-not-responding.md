There are a few reasons that slides may not respond.

**Presentation window is not focused**

The presentation window must be the top and focused window for PhonePresenter to work properly.  Click on the presentation window to focus it.


**Bad Wi-Fi Connection**

PhonePresenter may not work well on slow or weak Wi-Fi connections.  Move closer to or reorient the Wi-Fi router to get a better signal.


**Blocked by a Firewall**

Check that a firewall is not blocking the PhonePresenter server.

**Xdotool not installed**

PhonePresenter depends on xdotool when running on Linux.   Check that xdotool is installed.


**Conflicting with Synergy**

PhonePresenter may conflict with Synergy.  Temporarily turn off Synergy to fix the problem.
